				<h2>Choose how you play MYSELF</h2>
				<p>
					MYSELF is a dress-up experience you can approach in different ways. 
					You may play it traditionally, by hand, touching and arranging each piece with care, 
					or choose the digital version to dress, change, and observe at your own pace. 
					There is no goal to reach, no score to chase—only time to stay with yourself.
				</p>

				<h2>Brief History and Products</h2>
				<p>
					MYSELF was born on Sunday, February 8, 2026, as a small personal project by Nazwa Shabrina Zain, 
					a graphic designer seeking a quieter form of play. Designed for all ages and for everyone,
					without limiting gender.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first release introduced a paired base character set (female and male), followed by
					Orange Girl and a growing collection of outfits and items exploring mood, color,
					and personal narrative.
