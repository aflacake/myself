# MYSELF

**Traditional-Inspired Character Play & Digital Dress-Up Experience**

MYSELF is a visual character play project inspired by traditional toys, paper dolls, and slow, intentional interaction.

MYSELF exists in two forms:
- Physical (traditional/offline)
- Digital (free)

This is not a fast game.\ 
This is not a competitive experience.

MYSELF is a personal space for quiet play.

## Experiencing MYSELF

There is no single way to play MYSELF.

Visitors are invited to choose their own path, through physical touch, or through a digital space.

### Home

The Home page functions as a **visual storefront**.

It does not explain too much.\
It does not push decisions.

It introduces:
- The character
- The atmosphere
- Two ways to begin playing

### Play

Play is the central space of MYSELF.

Here, MYSELF opens into two approaches:
- Physical play (traditional)
- Digital play (free)

They exist side by side.\
One does not replace the other.

### Gallery

The Gallery is where MYSELF speaks without words.

It presents:
- Characters
- Outfits
- Poses
- Visual mood

The Gallery does not explain.\
It shows.

### About

MYSELF was not created to escape oneself.

It was created to pause, to assemble, and to observe.

This page reflects why MYSELF chooses a slower, more mature, more personal path.

### Credits/Legal

MYSELF is an independent, creator-owned project.

All artwork is protected by copyright.\
Free digital access does not imply free commercial use.

Boundaries are stated calmly and clearly.

### Updates

If MYSELF changes, it changes slowly.

This space records:
- Updates
- New visuals
- Small steps in the project’s journey

## Closing

MYSELF does not try to reach everyone.

It waits for those who still want to play without becoming children again.
